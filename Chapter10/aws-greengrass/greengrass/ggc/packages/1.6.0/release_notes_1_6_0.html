    <h1> AWS IoT Greengrass 1.6.0 Release Notes </h1>
    <p>AWS Greengrass is software that lets you run local compute, messaging, and device state synchronization for connected devices in a secure way. With AWS Greengrass, connected devices can run and update AWS Lambda functions, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices securely - even when not connected to the Internet. Using AWS Lambda, Greengrass ensures your IoT devices can respond quickly to local events, operate with intermittent connections, and minimize the cost of transmitting IoT data to the cloud.</p>
    <p>With AWS Greengrass, you can use AWS Lambda functions to build IoT devices and application logic. Greengrass provides cloud-based management of applications that can be deployed for local execution. Locally deployed Lambda functions are triggered by local events, messages from the cloud, or other sources.</p>
    <p>In AWS Greengrass, devices can securely communicate on a local network and exchange messages with each other without having to connect to the cloud.  AWS Greengrass provides a local pub/sub manager that can intelligently buffer messages if connectivity is temporarily lost.</p>
    <p>AWS Greengrass protects user data through the secure authentication and authorization of devices and through secure connectivity in the local network and between local devices and the cloud. Device security credentials function until they expire or are revoked, even if connectivity to the cloud is disrupted, so that the devices can continue to securely communicate locally.</p>
    <p>The AWS Greengrass core software comes packaged with an OTA Update Agent that is capable of updating the core's software or the OTA Update Agent itself to the latest respective versions.</p>

    <h2> What's New </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to currently supported languages, you can now write your Lambda function in C. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c">https://github.com/aws/aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c</a>.</li>
        <li>Greengrass now supports persisting MQTT messages to the local storage destined for the cloud. This update also allows you to change the queue size for stored messages.</li>
        <li>The /proc directory can be mounted as a local volume resource and accessed by Lambda functions running within the Greengrass core.</li>
        <li>The maximum reconnect retry period can be configured in the config.json file for when the core device is disconnected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Bug Fixes and Improvements </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Performance improvement for publishing messages within the Greengrass core and between devices and the core.</li>
        <li>Reduced the compute resources required to process logs generated by user-defined Lambda functions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Programming Greengrass Devices </h2>
    <p>Currently, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp">AWS IoT SDK for C++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python">AWS IoT SDK for Python</a> has a built-in support for Greengrass Core. Please refer to the examples included with the SDK for instructions on how to use it. Since Greengrass Core software utilizes a MQTT protocol, you may use other SDKs in order to connect to Greengrass. Please refer to the "Greengrass Discovery RESTful API" section of the developer guide for more information.</p>
    
    <h2> Installation </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the developer guide for the platform specific instructions on how to prepare your system to run Greengrass Core software.</li>
        <li>Download Greengrass Core package from AWS console for your platform.</li> 
        <li>
            Install Greengrass
            <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
                sudo tar -zxvf greengrass-&lt;platform&gt;-1.6.0.tar.gz -C /
            </code>
            This will extract the AWS Greengrass distributable into the <code white-space:pre-wrap>greengrass</code> directory in your root directory of the device.
        </li>
        <li>Copy your Greengrass Core certificates to <code white-space:pre-wrap>/greengrass/certs/</code> folder.</li>
        <li>Modify <code white-space:pre-wrap>/greengrass/config/config.json</code> file.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Feedback and Bug Reports </h2>
    <p>Please share feedback and bugs by contacting your AWS Account Manager or through our support team <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/</a>. When reporting issues, it will help speed resolution if you can describe your use case, the devices in the system and the Lambda functions you have deployed along with a compressed archive of the /greengrass/ggc/var/log/ folder contents.</p>
